# Assertive Display for Qualcomm SoC -- Magisk Module

This module loads display calibration based on the stock configuration of the Sony Xperia z3 for Qualcomm SoC based Android devices. Some folks have noticed significant improvements in screen-on-time battery life on the Nexus 6 (Shamu) phone with this tweak applied.

It may work on other devices but has not been tested.

### Installation / Uninstallation

Use Magisk Manager to install and uninstall.

### Disclaimer

Use this module at your own risk, you are solely responsible if anything bad happens. This module should work on any Qualcomm based phone but has only been tested on Nexus 6 with OmniROM 7.1.1. It shouldn't hurt any phone to try this but if you have a problem you can disable the Magisk Module in TWRP or temporarily uninstall Magisk from Recovery, reboot, remove the module via Magisk Manager and then reboot again.
